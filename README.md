# Model Template

Need to install [cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html)!

Then git clone this repo.

Then run `cookiecutter <path to this directory>` to setup a new ML repo to train & deploy a model. 

## TODOS:
- Add Makefile and GitHub Actions CI/CD
- Add DVC
